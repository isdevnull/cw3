# CourseWork3

Currently this is a project in development.

## Installation

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary packages.

It *may be a good idea to use your own separate environment* to avoid any local conflicts.

Also note that there may be problems with downloading `sktime` to your local computer. If you face any challenges, use google.colab

## Usage

Clone repo, run `python3 preprocessing.py` to get clean dataset and you are good to go! Hopefully, every result in notebooks is reproducible.
